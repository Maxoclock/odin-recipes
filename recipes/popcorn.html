    <h2>A unique topping for stovetop popcorn!</h2>
    <p>Popcorn made on the stove is an economical treat. Popcorn kernels are cheap to buy and can be stored for a long time.</p>
    <p>This popcorn recipe uses browned butter, nutritional yeast, and hot sauce as a delicious topping.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup popcorn kernels</li>
        <li>2 tbsp neutral oil</li>
        <li>1/4 cup salted butter</li>
        <li>1/4 cup nutritional yeast</li>
        <li>Hot sauce to taste (Franks is my recommendation)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium pot with lid, add the oil and kernels. The pot and lid should be heavy, with thick walls, else poor heat distribution will cause burnt kernels and oil.</li>
        <li>Turn heat to medium-high. Listen for popping. Once it begins popping, shake pot regularly.</li>
        <li>Once popping slows down to once every 3 seconds, take pot off heat and dump popcorn into a bowl.</li>
        <li>Return pot to stove. Add butter. Using the residual heat, melt the butter. Turn the element on to medium and brown your butter.</li>
        <li>Once butter is browned, add several dashes of hot sauce, then immediately pour over popcorn.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle nutritional yeast on popcorn and toss to distribute toppings evenly.</li>
    </ol>
