    <h2>Cooking beans from dried using a crockpot is the easiest!</h2>
    <p>By cooking our beans in a crockpot, we can skip the hours of soaking. Please note that some people who react negatively to beans (gas, etc) may find this method exacerbates their issues.</p>
    <p>If you're like me, this isn't a problem. We can cook our beans in the crockpot and use them in future recipes.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup dried beans (ex: navy)</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>Large pinch of salt</li>
        <li>Flavourings: smoked pork, bay leaves, onion (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Place all ingredients in crockpot. Recipe can be scaled up depending on how much you need to cook.</li>
    <li>Cook on low until beans are soft and creamy inside.</li>
</ol>
